Here's a README for the Twitter Trends project:

# Twitter Trends

Twitter Trends is a Java-based project that simulates a Twitter-like platform, allowing users to analyze tweets, identify trends, and flag potentially sensitive content.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main classes:

1. **TwitterMain**: The entry point of the application.
2. **TweetBot**: Manages a collection of tweets.
3. **TwitterTrends**: Analyzes tweets and identifies trends.

## Features

- **Tweet Management**: Add, remove, and cycle through tweets.
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify the most frequently used words in tweets.
- **Content Flagging**: Detect potentially sensitive or misleading content related to COVID-19.
- **Tweet Display**: Show tweets in a feed-like format.

## How It Works

1. The program reads tweets from a file named "tweets.txt".
2. It creates a TweetBot object to manage the tweets.
3. A TwitterTrends object is initialized to analyze the tweets.
4. The most frequently tweeted word is identified and displayed.
5. Tweets are displayed in a feed format, with potentially sensitive tweets flagged.

## Usage

To run the project:

1. Ensure you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
2. Compile the Java files:
   ```
   javac TwitterMain.java TweetBot.java TwitterTrends.java
   ```
3. Create a "tweets.txt" file with one tweet per line.
4. Run the program:
   ```
   java TwitterMain
   ```

## Sample Output

```
Most frequently tweeted word:
> [most frequent word]

Your Twitter feed:

- [Tweet 1]
- [Tweet 2]
 *This Tweet may be misleading. Learn the facts about COVID-19:

- [Tweet 3]
...
```

## Customization

- To modify the list of sensitive words, edit the `containsFlag` method in the `TwitterTrends` class.
- To change the source of tweets, modify the file name in the `TwitterMain` class.
